# Oxelcraft -- The simple LWJGL game.
## I made this, i just did this
# INFO
## This is *open source* in the code branch (the code is the 0.0.1 beta lol this will not be updated.)
### This is only for the website, you can get the launcher from the releases and new versions from [oxelcraft-vault](https://github.com/0XOPx/oxelcraft-vault.git)
# Requirements
# Windows
# Java 17 or more *(If you don't have Java 17 or more, go to this link to install Java 17 https://adoptium.net/temurin/releases/?version=17 also if you are on a OS diffrent than Windows, then you will need to launch the jarfile from the versions folder or you can just go to oxelcraft-vault if you don't have the jar, if you don't have .NET Framework 4.8 which is what the launcher is made in, this will work for you only.)*
# Information:
If you wan't to play, just remember it's easy to play, and is made in Java 17, you can go over Java 17 like i use Java 23 for testing. This project is built using Eclipse and Maven. The launcher is made in C# Windows Forms, you might wonder "How? There is a Java icon!" becuse i added it.
