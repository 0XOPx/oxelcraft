# OXELCRAFT GUIDES
-------------------
Welcome to the official installation guide for Oxelcraft, this will cover the basics of Getting Java, Getting the launcher, Getting the version.
But first - You need Java!
# INSTALLING JAVA
Go to the README, you'll find this line:
Java 17 or more (If you don't have Java 17 or more, go to this link to install Java 17 https://adoptium.net/temurin/releases/?version=17 also if you are on a OS diffrent than Windows, then you will need to launch the jarfile from the versions folder or you can just go to oxelcraft-vault if you don't have the jar, if you don't have .NET Framework 4.8 which is what the launcher is made in, this will work for you only.)
Go to https://adoptium.net/temurin/releases/?version=17 and install the Java version for your OS (This one has text):<br>

<br>You have it! Java 17!
# INSTALLING THE LAUNCHER
To get the launcher, go to the releases tab and go and install the latest version using this:

You have it! Just unzip it!
# INSTALLING VERSIONS
Well, the launcher does NOT COME WITH THE VERSIONS. You need to access the versions [here.](https://github.com/0XOPx/oxelcraft-vault)
So you've got it, right?
You need to install a file in this format:
oxelcraft-version-releasetype.jar
You know the "version" and "releasetype" are placeholders, right?
Then press cut on the file, go to launcher folder and versions.
Then paste.
You should see your version.
Then go back one folder, and then open oxelcraftlauncher.exe it opens the launcher
Then select your version in here:

<br>*Info: if you modified the versions folder to add more versions or a version, click the "Refresh Versions" button.*
<h1>If you have Windows, you could use another method of installing, it's named **"Opt"** - my package manager, here's the command for installing it:</h1>
<code>
opt install oxelcraftlauncher
</code>
<h1> OTHER OSES THAN WINDOWS - COME HERE.</h1>
When you got the jar, you need to do this:
<br>Go to terminal and type this command:
<code>
java -jar oxelcraft-x-x-x-BETA
</code>
It could also be
<code>
java -jar oxelcraft-x-x-x-ALPHA
</code>
or (i'm serious, this is the last one)
<code>
java -jar oxelcraft-x-x-x-RELEASE
</code>
Then you have the game launched now!
